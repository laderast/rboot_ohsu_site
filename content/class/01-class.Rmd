### Muddiest Points

> I'm not a programmer person so the concept of a programming environment is pretty mystifying. That said, it doesn't stop me from applying what you're teaching us, so no real worries there.

Stick with it!

> The challenges since I lost where we were and had to back track all of the time to see where the instructor was.

Ok, I will do my best to announce which section we are on in the notebook.

> na.omit

We wil get to that today.
	
>	folder organization; projects vs notebooks?

We will talk about that today.
