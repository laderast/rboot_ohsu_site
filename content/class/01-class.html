<h3>Muddiest Points</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not a programmer person so the concept of a programming environment is pretty mystifying. That said, it doesn’t stop me from applying what you’re teaching us, so no real worries there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The challenges since I lost where we were and had to back track all of the time to see where the instructor was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, I will do my best to announce which section we are on in the notebook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>na.omit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We wil get to that today.</p>
<blockquote>
