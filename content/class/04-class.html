<h2>Midterm will be assigned next week</h2>
<p>For this week, identify 1 dataset from the <code>tidytuesday</code> datasets and identify a research question that you think can be answered by the data. Be curious!</p>
<p>Your dataset should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>categorical variables</li>
<li>continuous variables</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday" class="uri">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday</a></p>
<p>We will take part of next class doing short meetings to discuss the midterm and the datasets individually.</p>
<div id="post-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Post-Class</h3>
<p>Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?</li>
<li>Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?</li>
<li>Anything Else: Is there something you’d like me to know?</li>

<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How functions that we saw used with across() work, such as where() and start_with() (are they for across() only or do they work in other areas too?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have more time to cover this in class, but I will show you how to get started with the <code>tidyowl</code> tutorial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m still not clear why we create a factor. I did the gender code without factoring and the table was the same when I included the factoring code. Why would i add this work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scale_x/y_continuous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will try and come up with more examples. This is a very handy reference: <a href="http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-axis-ticks-a-guide-to-customize-tick-marks-and-labels" class="uri">http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-axis-ticks-a-guide-to-customize-tick-marks-and-labels</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I struggled a bit with case_when () function and understanding how it is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have put together a few more examples and we will try to go over them in class.</p>
