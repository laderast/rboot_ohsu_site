<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>joining datasets</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Joining tables will take some more practice before it fully sticks for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not unclear but nervous about joining tables with big datasets. But the GIFs are super helpful for illustrating the concept!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inner,left and right join functions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>joining tables, specifically when to use which type of join, but I feel it will become more clear with practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>how to know when to use “left” , “right” join etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will put together some more examples next week, with larger datasets, so you can compare the different kinds of joins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which figures require long/short dataframes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>still trying to figure out when to turn stuff into a factor. I think I sort of understand it but I’m not super confident.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They weren’t “unclear” but maybe more practice with pivot_longer, left_join, etc. would have been helpful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will have more practice exercises for these.</p>
