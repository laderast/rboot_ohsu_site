<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I still find purr very confusing. But I am beginning to understand it more after using it on linear regression models</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the nesting of tables and the following functions we applied still bends my mind a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nest() and unnest() seem really really cool but I would be interested to learn a little bit more about how they’re used</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>purrr df/model tables. You say it’s a way to screen a lot of models, but it really seems like a way to apply one model to a bunch of dfs. Like, you’d need another dimension to test more models.</p>

<div id="thank-you" class="section level2">
<h2>Thank you</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>While the nesting and un-nesting were more challenging topics, I thought the examples were great and I felt pretty good about everything by the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that ggpairs was a cool function and would have been useful for the biostats project</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for teaching cool stuff :)</p>

<h2>Our Minds are Full</h2>

<p>My brain is always so full by the end of the class that I forget what was fuzzy and what was clear.</p>
