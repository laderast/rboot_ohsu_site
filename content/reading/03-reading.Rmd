## Required

### `ggplot2`

- [ggplot2 BERD workshop slides](https://sph-r-programming.netlify.app/ggplot_flipbookr_berd/04_ggplot_slides.html) - lots more on different `geoms` and how to customize plots

### `dplyr`

- [`dplyr` cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) - one of the best references.
- [Combining functions using the pipe operator, %>%](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/wrangling.html#combining-functions-using-the-pipe-operator) - if you're confused about `%>%`, please read this.

## Optional

### Customizing ggplot2 

If you are interested in learning more about ggplot:

- [Themes to improve your ggplot figures](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures/) by David Keyes is really helpful for learning how to do more styling. 
- RStudio also publishes a [ggplot cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) that is really handy!
- [Customizing ggplot2 Cheatsheet](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) is also handy, because it organizes ggplot2 commands by task.
- Documentation for all `ggplot` features is available [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).



### Using `tidyselect` (Intermediate Level)

Remember, `select()` works on columns.

`tidyselect` lets you select columns by matching names. In conjunction with the `across()` command, you can apply the same operation to multiple columns at once. This is especially handy when you need to produce a summary on all numeric columns.

You can run the `tidyselect` tutorial by running the code in your Rstudio cloud console:

```
library(tidyowl)
learn_tidyselect()
```
