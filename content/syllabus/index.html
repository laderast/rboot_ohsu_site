<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course is meant to be a gentle introduction to data wrangling and visualization using the <code>tidyverse</code> in R. This course focuses on practical data science skills in R (loading data, data wrangling, visualization, automation, machine learning, and running statistical models) that you’ll use almost everyday in your work. It is meant for both beginners and students wanting to brush up on their R skills.</p>

<h2>Words of Encouragement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This was adopted from Andrew Heiss. Thanks!</p>

<p>I <em>promise</em> you can succeed in this class.</p>
<p>Learning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like <code>ggplot2</code>—<a href="https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/">made this wise observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.</p>

<h2>LeaRning is Social</h2>
<p>The students who have a bad time in my workshops and courses are the ones who don’t work with each other to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.</p>
<p>If you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.</p>
