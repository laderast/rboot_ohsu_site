## `bind_rows()`

### Motivation for `bind_rows()`

Imagine that your lab is part of a large consortium studying the effects of smoking. As the lead data scientist, you've helped oversee the collection and documentation several observations for many variables of interest.

Many labs within the consortium have accumulated data, and not all were following the guidelines you set for the tables.

```{r}
smoke_1 <- read_excel(here('data/smoke_1.xlsx'), 
                      sheet=1, 
                      na="NA")

smoke_1
```

```{r}
smoke_2 <- read_excel(here('data/smoke_2.xlsx'), 
                      sheet=1, 
                      na="NA")

smoke_2
```

```{r}
smoke_3 <- read_excel(here('data/smoke_3.xlsx'), 
                      sheet=1, 
                      na="NA")

smoke_3
```

## Binding two tables together

How can you combine  datasets from individual labs? Enter `bind_rows()`...

```{r}
smoke_1 %>% bind_rows(smoke_2)
```

`bind_rows()` allows you to append one dataset to the bottom of another dataset. We can see that `smoke_1` contained 549 rows and `smoke_2` contained 603 rows. After using `bind_rows()`, we now have a single dataset containing 1152 rows.

That's all pretty cool, until you meet a rogue lab. This lab almost seems as if they've gone out of their way to make things difficult. Rather than putting columns in the standard order specified, they've switched them around. 

Even worse, they've named the columns differently! If there are only a few columns, sure, we could manually fix this. But what if this was RNASeq data, with thousands of column names to fix?!

Well, let's remember we still have `clean_names()`. That can at least help us get the column names into the standard format.

```{r}
smoke_3_clean <- smoke_3 %>%
    clean_names()
```

Our column names are at least the same, but they're still out of order! If we append `smoke_3_clean` to `smoke_1`, `vital_status` will be appened under `primary_diagnosis`, `age_at_diagnosis` will be appended under `tumor_stage`, and so on. Do we need to reorder the columns before we append them?

```{r}
smoke_1 %>%
    bind_rows(smoke_3_clean) %>%
    View()
```

Well look at that. `bind_rows()` takes care of the out-of-order columns for us!



## Joining Tables



### Motivation

You have data on patients from two sources - one are labs, and they supply patient ids. The second source comes from an electronic medical record. How do you combine these two into a single table?



### Naming conventions

![](image/original-dfs.png)
source: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain


Before we talk about joins, we need to define some terms.

`left table` and `right table`: Whenever we join two tables, we will have 

- a *left* table (in this case, the `x` table) and 
- a *right* table (in this case, the `y` table). 

`key`: In order to join the two tables, we have to somehow map the rows of our left table (`x`) with the rows of our other table (`y`). We do this by joining together rows with a common variable. In our case, we need to join rows based on the first column in both tables. The column that we join on is called a *key*. 

![](image/original-dfs.png)
source: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain

In the above example, we see that there is a row in `x` whose *key* is 2, and there is a row in `y` whose *key* is 2 as well. So it makes sense to join these two rows together.

So, by matching the rows with identical keys, we can put together a table that incorporates information from both tables. 



### Inner Joins

![Inner join animation](image/inner-join.gif)
source: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain

With an inner join, we are matching rows based on our *key*. If there is not a match in both tables, we don't include the row with that key.

In the example above, we don't keep row 3 in table x or row 4 in table y.



## Joining Syntax

Keeping these terms in mind, let's look at the syntax for joining two tables together.

```
inner_join(table_x, table_y,
          by = c(key_column_x = key_column_y)
          )
```

If we just wanted to join the two tables, the above is enough. We first specify the left table (`table_x`), and the right table (`table_y`).

Note the `by` argument. This is the argument where we specify which column in each table contains our key. 



### The more `dplyr` way to do joins

The more `dplyr` way to do joins is below:

```
#start with left table
table_x %>% 

  #join left table with right table
  inner_join(y = table_y, 
  
  #point out the key column in each table
    by = c(key_column_x= key_column_y)
    )
```

We start with our *left* table, `table_x`. The main difference is that we don't need to specify the `x` argument in `inner_join()`, because we are piping `table_x` as the first argument of `inner_join()`.



## Left Joins

![](image/left-join.gif)

Left joins are a little different. In a *left join*, we keep all the rows in the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right table.

In the example above, we keep row 3 in table x even though it doesn't have a match in table y. 

Because there is no information from the right table, these rows will have an `NA`. That is, the information is missing for the columns that come from the right table.




### Let's work through an example


Say we have a set of patients. We want to join their information with their labs, in particular a white blood cell count (a WBC). 

We also need to know whether there are patients in our set who haven't gotten a CBC.

Because the lab system isn't part of the electronic health record, we'll need to make a join on the patient table to the lab table.


```{r}
patient_table <- read_excel("data/patient_example.xlsx", sheet = 1)

wbc_table <- read_excel("data/patient_example.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

Let's look at `patient_table`, which we'll use as our *left table*:

```{r}
patient_table
```

Here is `wbc_table`, which we'll use as our *right table*:

```{r}
wbc_table
```

Let's do an `inner_join()`:

```{r}
patient_table %>%
  inner_join(y = wbc_table,
            by = c("patient_id" = "patient_id"))

```



### Your Turn

Modify the code below to do a `left_join()` on `patient_table` and `wbc_table`. 

```{r}
patient_table %>%
  inner_join(y = wbc_table,
            by = c("patient_id" = "patient_id"))

```

Which patient in `patient_table` didn't get a WBC?


## Making your data long: `pivot_longer()`


![](image/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)


The last thing we'll talk about is the difference between the *wide* data format and the *long* data format.

A really common format in bioinformatics is the *expression matrix*.

In an *expression matrix*, 
  the *rows* correspond to different *genes* and
  the *columns* correspond to different *samples*.


```{r}
expression_example <- read_excel("data/expression_example.xlsx", sheet=1)

expression_example
```



### However...

This format isn't super useful for a lot of data manipulations.

It's because the columns correspond to samples, and this prevents us from plotting things like PTEN expression across the samples. 

This kind of data is in a format that is called *wide* format. What we need to do is collapse the numerical values into a single column.




### The magic of `pivot_longer()`


![](image/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)


`pivot_longer()` is the function that will let us make our *wide* data *long*.

It takes three arguments

- `cols` - the columns to collapse. We haven't talked about `tidyselect` verbs, but there are a few that let you select columns based on naming criteria. Here we're using the `starts_with()` selector to grab the columns that begin with `tcga`

- `names_to` - the name of the column where the labels will be consolidated to

- `values_to` - the name of the column where the values in the columns in the wide data will be consolidated to.


```{r}
expression_long <- 
  expression_example %>%
    pivot_longer(cols= starts_with("tcga"), 
                 names_to = "sample", 
                 values_to = "expression")

expression_long
```



### Doing things with the long data

Now that we have our long data, we can do our usual kinds of plotting.

```{r}
ggplot(expression_long) +
  aes(x=gene_symbol, y=expression, fill=gene_symbol) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We can even make expression heatmaps with `geom_tile`. 

```{r}
ggplot(expression_long) +
  aes(x=sample, y= gene_symbol, fill=expression) +
  geom_tile()

```


### `pivot_wider()` exists too!

And part of your assignment will be to figure out how to use it.


## Assignment

1. Use `bind_rows()` to bind all three `smoke` datasets (`smoke_1`, `smoke_2`, and `smoke_3`) together. Hint: you'll have to do two `bind_row()` operations.

```{r}


```



2. Take a look at the `patient` and `patient_encounter` tables loaded below.

```{r}
patient <- read_csv("data/patient_example.csv")
patient_encounter <- read_csv("data/patient_enc_example.csv")

```


How many rows does each table have?

```{r eval=FALSE}
nrow()
nrow()
```


Write a `inner_join()` and assign it to `inner_patient` with 

- `patient` as the *left* table
- `patient_encounter` as the *right* table
- joining on the approriate columns (look at the column names carefully!)


```{r eval=FALSE}
inner_patient <- patient %>%
  inner_join(y = ____, by = c())

inner_patient
```

How many rows does `inner_patient` have?



Do a `left_join` of the two tables with the same criteria as above. Assign it to `left_patient`. 

Count the number of rows in `left_patient`. Is it what you expected?

```{r eval=FALSE}
left_patient <- patient %>%
  left_join()

nrow(left_patient)
```


3. Look up the documentation for `pivot_wider`. Transform `expression_longer` back to a *wide* format, but this time with **columns** as *genes* and **rows** as *samples*.

Hint: Always look at the examples in the documentation! They'll help you.

```{r eval=FALSE}
expression_longer %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = ,
              names_from = ,
              values_from)


```
