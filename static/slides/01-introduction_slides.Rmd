# This is a Safe Space to Ask Questions

---
# Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.

---
# Code of Conduct Violations

Please report them to me directly or to Eric if you feel comfortable.

If not, please use the anonymous reporting form here: https://forms.gle/7CTv1p573MAHEdX69


---
# Tour of Zoom

- We'll be using zoom for our classes
- Let's do a quick guided tour

# Letting me Know

When we're doing the activity, use the hands up in Zoom to indicate that you're finished.

If you have questions, please ask them in chat.

---
# Let's Try Out Chat (10 minutes)

Open the chat window (if we are in full screen, press the escape key, and then click on the chat icon)

# Let's try the Breakout Rooms

- Let's try it (3 minutes)
- Icebreaker: What is your favorite all purpose condiment (such as salsa, ketchup, or chile oil?) and why?

---
# Zoom Recordings/Attendance

- I will record each session and Eric will post it as soon it is ready
- I will pause recording for breakout rooms (that won't be recorded)
- Remind me to start recording when class starts

---
# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. **Understand** and **utilize** **R/RStudio**.
2. **Understand** basic data types and data structures in R.
3. **Familiarize** and **load** data files (Excel, Comma Separated Value files) into R/Rstudio, with tips on formatting.
4. **Visualize** datasets using **ggplot2** and understand how to build basic plots using **ggplot2** syntax.
5. **Filter** and **format** data in R for use with various routines.
6. **Manipulate** and **combine** multiple files.
7. **Automate** repetitive tasks in R, such as loading a folder of files.
8. **Execute** and **Interpret** some basic statistics in R.
9. **Execute** basic machine learning workflows using `tidymodels`, including PCA, resampling, and Supervised Learning.
10. **Your Choice**: `shiny`, `leaflet`, `tidytext` or `Bioconductor`.

# Let's look at the website:
## http://sph-r-programming.netlify.app

---
# Caveat Emptor

- This is *not* a conventional programming course
- We try to get you doing interesting and useful things from the beginning
- We use `tidyverse` because it helps you get up and running quickly
- This is also *not* a full course on statistics or machine learning

---
# Textbooks

All textbooks are available online and are free to use.

We'll be using the following for reference:

**Getting Used to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown**. Chester Ismay.
<https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/>

**Introduction to Data Science**. Tiffany Timbers, Trevor Campbell, Melissa Lee. <https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/>

**RMarkdown for Scientists**. Nick Tierney. <https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/>

**R for Data Science**. Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>

# My Approach to Teaching

I think students learn the best when they're actually looking and thinking about data.

This means we will be looking at lots of data.

---
# Social Learning Works

I also think that we learn best when we are discussing data together.

You'll be assigned a buddy at the beginning of each class

---
# Format of Class

- Review of muddiest points (10-15 minutes)
- Main Learning (2 hours)
- Function of the Week presentations (20 minutes)
- Wrap Up/Questions (remaining time)

We'll take 5 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

---
# Grading Breakdown

- Attendance 10%
- Midterm Project 15%
- Function of the Week 5%
- Homework Assignments 45%
- Final Project 25%

---
# Class Attendance Policy

Please try to attend class. 

There is a post-class survey that will be posted. Please fill it out, as it counts as attendance.

If you can't attend class, please let me know.

---
# Class Assignments

Class Assignments will be done in RStudio Notebooks 

Assignments will be submitted through Sakai. 

We will do our best to return it to you within a week.

We will highlight any points of confusion.

---
# Function of the Week

- Starts in Week 3
- Learn and share about an underrated `tidyverse()` function (5 minutes max)
- Share your experience with the function
  - Is it useful?
  - Is it hard to use?
  - Share an example
- You will have time to meet with me before you present
  
---
# Midterm / Final Project

- Midterm: Pick a dataset and show that you can explore it, plot it, and transform it to answer a specific question
  - Schedule a meeting to discuss the data
- Final: Pick a different dataset and build a model using machine learning or statistics and present it
  - Schedule a meeting to discuss the dataset

---
# Class Discord

- Invitation to Class Discord is on Sakai and emailed to you
- Use to ask questions
- If you know the answer, try to help out
- I will try and review once a day
- Video channels for working together

---
# Office Hours

I will be available for office hours/drop in time 2 Hours a week. You're free to sign in to the Zoom Room and work on homework at this time.

When is good link: 

Highlight all times that work for you.

---
# Why R?

R is an extremely powerful language for **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, **data manipulation**, and **visualization**.

It's a *hub* language in that you can access many different kinds of systems (TensorFlow, Databases, Apache Spark) without needing to know other languages.

---
# R is Not Easy

- Learning R can be a difficult, but rewarding process
- Be patient with yourself, don't beat yourself up
- We'll try to make it a fun process for you

---
# Testimonies (You Can Do It!)

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
"I started out very anxious about being able to learn R effectively and your class was a very gentle entry point that covered quite a lot of material. I feel like I'm going to be able to search and figure out much of what I want to accomplish now."]

---
# Testimonies

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
 "I have used other standard softwares for my stats during my doctoral program and was always intimidated by R. I am so glad I found this course, after going through numerous online videos & courses. It is taking me time to learn through your course, but I am confident that this time I will get through it."]

---
# R and RStudio

- In-class labs and assignments will be done with [RStudio.cloud](http://rstudio.cloud)
- We'll take a guided tour of RStudio Cloud next

---
# Other Resources/Events (Optional)

- [PDX R User Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/) (monthly)
  - Intro to tidyselect (1/21 @ 6:30)
